# sorting-algorithms-in-C
A list of basic sorting algorithms in C

## algorithms with time complexity of O(N$^{2}$)
1. bubble sorting
Bubble sorting is a simple algorithm that compares every two elements of the list. Once found a element bigger than the latter, swap these two elements.
2. selection sorting
Selection sorting is a simple algorithm that selects the smallest element in the list and put it at the head the list, then repeat this procedure in the remaining list until the list is sorted.
3. insertion sorting
Insertion sorting is a simple algorithm that scans the sorted part of list for the proper position to insert the new element, then repeat this procedure in the remaining list until the list is sorted.
